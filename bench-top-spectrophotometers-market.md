<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bench-Top Spectrophotometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-beam</li><li>Double-beam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bench-top spectrophotometers are essential analytical instruments used in laboratories for measuring light absorption and transmission in various samples. The market can be categorized into two main types: single-beam and double-beam spectrophotometers. Single-beam models measure sample absorbance in a single path, making them simpler and usually more cost-effective. In contrast, double-beam spectrophotometers split the light source, allowing simultaneous measurement of a reference and sample, which enhances accuracy and stability, especially for dynamic samples or varying environmental conditions.</p></p>
